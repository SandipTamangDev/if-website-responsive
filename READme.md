# Responsive CSS Stylesheet Project

This is a solution for creating a clean, modern, and responsive CSS stylesheet. The goal was to build a fully responsive layout using CSS variables, clamp-based typography, and smooth mobile navigation — all with a focus on maintainability and scalability.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming  
- Responsive typography using `clamp()` for fluid scaling  
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout and alignment  
- Mobile-first approach with a full-screen mobile navigation menu  
- Smooth transitions and scroll lock for mobile nav  

### What I learned

This project was less about discovering new tech and more about mastering the fundamentals and making my code *actually* scalable and maintainable. Here’s the real tea:

- **CSS variables:** Using `:root` for colors and fonts made tweaking the theme way easier than hardcoding values everywhere. If I want to switch colors, I don’t have to dig through a million lines of CSS — game changer for future projects.  
- **Clamp() for typography:** I used `clamp()` for font sizes to make text scale nicely on all screen sizes without media queries cluttering the CSS. This was new to me and it’s legit the future of responsive fonts.  
- **Mobile nav and UX:** Building a mobile menu with scroll lock and transitions taught me how tricky UX can be when juggling multiple states and user interactions. I learned the importance of clean, reusable classes and transitions that don’t feel sluggish or glitchy.  
- **Attention to detail:** Matching the spacing, font weights, and hover states to the design pushed me to slow down and get precise rather than just rushing code. This helped me level up my design eye and made me realize how much detail matters for a polished final product.  
- **Workflow improvements:** Writing this README helped me organize my thoughts and practice explaining my work clearly — a skill I undervalued before. Documentation is part of being a professional dev, no shortcuts here.

No sugar-coating: this project was a grind but totally worth it. My code got cleaner, my CSS skills got sharper, and my confidence went up. The biggest takeaway? Solid fundamentals + good habits beat flashy tech any day.

If you have feedback or want to collab on improvements, hit me up — I’m always down to get better.
